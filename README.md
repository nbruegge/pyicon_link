Pyicon is a python post-processing and visualization toolbox for ICON with a focus on ocean data. The three main features of pyicon are:

a number of functions to facilitate the every-day script-based plotting of ICON data
an interactive (ncview-like) plotting GUI for Jupyter notebook
a monitoring suite for ICON ocean simulations which combines dedicated diagnostic plots of an ICON simulation on a website

Pyicon is developed within the DFG-project TRR181 - Energy Transfers in Atmosphere and Ocean.
